<center><h1></h1></center>


<p><b>There are a lot of amazing experiences that I had experienced during my studies.</b></p>
<p><b>During my Diploma I had join 2 international programs 1 national and several University level programs.</b></p>
<p><b>All of them gave me valuable experiences no matter what the level is.</b></p>
<p><b>The one that I am mostly proud of is The Beijing Summer Camp program.
<p><b>I never thought that I would be chosen due to the limited number of participants that will be chosen from all around Malaysia.</b></p>
<p><b>But I did it! The moments are so amazing I really feels like I am  part of their students there.</b></p>
<p><b>Making new friends from China and also from all parts of Malaysia. All of us are from different universities but we manage to enjoy our 14 days in China like a family.</b></p>
<p><b>If I had a chance to join such program again I would love to. This is because I can gain new best experiences that I can never experienced here in Malaysia.</b></p>
<p><b>I also had the chance to travel while studying during that program so, yeah it is absolutely amazing! I really hope that Covid-19 pandemic will be recovered soon.</b></p>
<p><b>Below is a Beijing map. There I had already able you to click & travel virtually to some places the places that I had been before nearby Beijing City.</b></p>
